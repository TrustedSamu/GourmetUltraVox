# Ultravox Websocket Example

This is an example of integrating with [Ultravox](https://ultravox.ai) using a websocket connection in Python. It uses the `websockets` library from PyPI.

See [the documentation](https://docs.ultravox.ai) for more information, such as other kinds of data messages that can be sent and received.

## Features

* Real-time bidirectional audio streaming via websocket
* Configurable system prompts, voices, etc.
* Robust audio handling alongside full interruption support
* Example "Dr. Donut" drive-thru attendant implementation
* Built-in client-side tool example for use with Dr. Donut

## Prerequisites

* [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for python environment and package management
* Valid Ultravox API key

## Running

1. Start by setting your api key environment variable.

```bash
export ULTRAVOX_API_KEY=<your_key>
```

2. Now you can run the example.

```bash
uv run websocket_client.py
```

Note that on the first run, uv will set up your Python environment and download relevant dependencies.

3. There are several command-line options to customize the call if you like.

```bash
# See all available options
uv run websocket_client.py --help

# Use a custom voice and system prompt
uv run websocket_client.py -V Mark --system-prompt "your prompt here"

# Run with debug logging
uv run websocket_client.py -v
```

## Development Tools

This project uses uv with ruff for formatting and linting.

```bash
uv run ruff format
uv run ruff check --fix
```


## Additional Notes

If you'd like to use this as a starting point for your own code, here are some important points to understand:

* User audio is constantly streamed in its own task. Ultravox relies on continuous audio for timing and interruptions, so it's important that your implementation do something similar.  You should aim to send 20ms of audio every 20ms, though different frame sizes also work.
* The example uses 48kHz audio for input and output. This is configurable, but be sure to pick and set an appropriate rate for your use case.
* The example uses a local speaker and microphone. This is useful for demonstration, but any real server-side implementation will presumably want to pipe audio to/from somewhere else, such as your client over webRTC. (To connect to Ultravox Realtime directly from a client, use one of the webRTC client SDKs.)
* The example handles PlaybackClearBuffer messages so that 30s of audio can be buffered on the client without impacting interruptions. If you choose to remove PlaybackClearBuffer handling, you should also reduce `clientBufferSizeMs` to ensure interruptions can still terminate generated audio promptly. The default is 60ms, which strikes a reasonable balance between perceived interrupt latency and possible audio underflow.
* The example adds an `apiVersion` query parameter in the url. This parameter is optional as there is currently only one version of the websocket API (version 1).
* This example ignores user transcripts and doesn't handle agent transcripts robustly. See [the webRTC client SDK](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ultravox-client-sdk-python/blob/7b9cf372c0bdc75657c398e4bbf44cebed2cf8b0/ultravox-client/ultravox_client/session.py#L381) for an example of more complete handling.

## üöÄ Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build an engaging AI voice assistant using Ultravox's WebSocket API. The assistant takes the form of a fun donut shop drive-thru operator, complete with:
- Real-time voice interactions
- Beautiful animated UI
- Natural language understanding
- Dynamic state management
- Interactive menu handling

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Voice Interface**: Real-time voice input/output using WebSocket streaming
- **Interactive UI**: Animated donut drive-thru theme with microphone button
- **State Management**: Visual feedback for listening, thinking, and speaking states
- **Menu System**: Complete donut shop menu with prices
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection and state issues

## üîß Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ultravox-websocket-example-client.git
cd ultravox-websocket-example-client
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your Ultravox API key:
```bash
export ULTRAVOX_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python web_app.py
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```
